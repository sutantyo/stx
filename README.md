### Japanese Mystical Archive Set Foil vs Collector Booster (CB) Foil

Here is a little guide to help you understand the difference between a Japanese
Mystical Archive foil from a Collector Booster box and one from a Japanese Set Booster box.
The difference is very easy to spot once you have seen them in real life, especially
if you have one of each (more on that later).

The motivation of course is that there are likely to be much less Japanese Set Booster boxes,
and the pull rate for foils is much less compared to a CB box (sometimes there are none in a box). 
Hareruya have priced this accordingly:
