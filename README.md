### Japanese Mystical Archive Set Foil vs Collector Booster (CB) Foil

Here is a little guide to help you understand the difference between a Japanese
Mystical Archive foil from a Collector Booster box and one from a Japanese Set Booster box.
The difference is very easy to spot once you have seen them in real life, especially
if you have one of each (more on that later).

The motivation of course is that there are likely to be much less Japanese Set Booster boxes,
plus since the pull rate for foils is much less compared to a CB box (sometimes there are none in a box),
so we expect the set foils to carry a premium. 
Hareruya have priced this accordingly:

#### Rainbow effect (see the textbox)

In general the foiling in the set foils is more subtle while the foiling on the CB foils is the usual 'rainbow' foil. 
If you hit the cards with light at a certain angle, it is quite obvious as the picture below shows. The
middle card (God's Willing) is a set foil, and sandwiched between the two CB foils, it doesn't even look like
a foil in this picture.

See the following video as well (again, the set foil is God's Willing).

It is most obvious on the textbox.

#### Rarity symbol

On the set foil, the rarity symbol has the rainbow effect, while the rest of the card is more subtle, so
they will pop out more compared to the rarity symbol in a CB foil. The rarity symbol in a CB foil does not
change colour that much, so 
if you can see a rainbow effect on
the rarity symbol, there's a good chance that it is a set foil. The following Lightning Bolt is
a set foil:

Here is the rainbow effect in action:

Of course this is harder to see in some cards, but generally it's very hard to see the uncommon (silver)
and gold (rare) rarity symbols on the CB foils, and the mythic (red) rarity symbol will hardly change.
You can see in the following video.

#### Texture

The next one is harder to spot, and it is not something I use to identify set or CB foils (the above is
more than enough), but more for a discussion. In my opinion, the foiling effect on the set foil is
much more smoother, and this feels like a new foil treatment. 

Here is a closeup of a CB foil:

and here is a closeup of the set foil:

You can see a bit more texture in the CB foil, which is how I expect foils to look. 

#### Does it matter?

The first time I saw the difference in these two foils, I immediately thought the set foil was much better, and
of course this is reflected by the price. However, I inspected these cards under a bright task lamp. 
Under normal circumstances (e.g. under sunlight), 
the difference is not as stark, and in fact the set foils are so subtle, they do not
even look like foils. 

If it bothers you so much, you can also use a matte sleeves on these cards. You can see the effect on the following
video. Both cards are CB foils, one of them inside an UltraPro matte sleeve.

You can see a massive difference as you insert them:

I hope this has been helpful!
